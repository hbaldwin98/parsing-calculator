# Calculators

Two calculators created because I was bored. One using a lexer/parser, tokenizing the input and using a 
recursive-descent parser to build an abstract-syntax tree that can then be interpreted, the other using a stack converting
the infix expression to a more formal postfix expression and then evaluating the input.
